Reads excel spreadsheets with tables of data rows and property columns and builds data into objects. Can be used to build a Entity Framework-esque Context class to provide data I/O using Excel as a backing store. Initially created as a easy way to handle data entry via the Entity Framework Code First migration seed method.
